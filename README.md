# Conduit

Conduit is a Medium clone built using Django, React, Python, JavaScript and HTML.

## Technologies Used

1. **Django**: A high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

2. **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook.

3. **Python**: A high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable.

4. **JavaScript**: An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.

5. **HTML**: Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.7.2.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/atullal/conduit.git`.
3. Navigate into the cloned repository: `cd conduit`.
4. Install virtualenv, a tool for creating isolated Python environments. You can install it with `pip install virtualenv`.
5. Create a new virtual environment called "ENV": `virtualenv ENV`.
6. Activate the virtual environment: `source ENV/bin/activate`.

    At this point, your command line prompt should start with `(ENV)`.

7. Install the required packages by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
8. The project should now build and run with: `python manage.py runserver`.

If your command line prompt does not start with `(Env)` at this point, try running `source ENV/bin/activate`.

If virtualenv is still not working, please raise an issue in the GitHub repository so we can help you out.
